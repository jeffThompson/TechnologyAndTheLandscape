# SPRAWLING TECHNOLOGIES

Urban sprawl is at the core of so many Americans’ lifestyles, and it has been for the past 60 years or more. It is so ingrained in our thoughts of what the American landscape is supposed to be that we often put little thought into it or how it has affected the landscape through technology. But sprawl has an important and fascinating history, and thanks to technologies that became enablers, sprawl has vastly altered the physical American landscape, changes that are continuing into the present day. Technology, such as, of course, the automobile, but also the railway, streetcars, and the internet were all enablers in the creation of sprawl through different periods of time, and combined with cultural forces, it became the dominant form of American development, arguably only slowing down until recently. Technology also has the ability to abate the problems of sprawl, but it can only do so much, since the problems with sprawl are ultimately a flawed design and premise. Thus, unfortunately for those who think technology can solve all of our problems, the only real solution to sprawl is to counter it with multipurpose, better-designed communities, often called “smart growth” communities in the United States. This project aims to explore how technology has enabled sprawl, the problems associated with it, and the ways technology can mitigate some of the negative effects of sprawl.

## WHAT IS SPRAWL

Sprawl. Merely the world conjures up images of lawns, garages, cars, seemingly factory-made homes, congested highways, big box stores, and strip malls. The word itself often takes on a negative connotation, an ugly sounding word meaning to suggest the ungainliness of a sprawling community. We all know what sprawl is. Most of us probably grew up in what could be considered ‘sprawl’.  But how do we technically define what constitutes ‘sprawl’? The answer is not as simple as it seems. The Rollins Group of Public Health at Emory University defines sprawl as "rapid geographic expansion of metropolitan areas in a ‘leapfrog,’ low density pattern, segregation of distinct land uses, heavy dependence on automobile travel with extensive road construction, architectural and social homogeneity, shift of capital investment and economic opportunity from the city center to the periphery, and relatively weak regional planning." [\[1\]](#1) This seems to touch base with the images that sprawl conjures up. Low density pattern implies the presence of big lawns, segregation of uses contributes to the dependance of cars, architectural and social homogeneity represent the way houses in sprawling communities seem so similar, etc. But this definition also includes some of the negative social factors of sprawl. Namely, the way that sprawl shifts the economic gravity of a metropolitan area from the center. This often takes the form of what is known as “white flight”, or when predominantly white populations leave the city center, leaving behind a majority-minority population. “When whites leave the city, they also leave neighborhoods, fundamentally changing the character of entire communities.”[\[2\]](#2) Thus, we can define sprawl as a specific and negative process.

Where did sprawl come from? What is the history of sprawl? Suburbanization and sprawl has been a part of urban life for thousands of years, going back to the ancient Romans. “Outside the walls of Rome was what citizens called suburbium, meaning what was literally below or outside the walls. Here were land uses that couldn’t be accommodated in the city. Along the roads that led out of town grew up settlements that clustered around industrial facilities, cemeteries, and businesses catering to travelers entering and leaving the city.” [\[3\]](#3) People have been escaping the city to do things they couldn’t do there forever.

Over time, technology enabled sprawl to take on more distinct and powerful forms. Arguably the greatest technological enabler of sprawl manifested in the United States with the 1893 invention of the automobile. With that technology came social movements, such as the Good Roads Movement, which “worked to define highways as a ‘public good.’”. [\[4\]](#4) Other technologies, namely the streetcar, created the “streetcar suburb”, an earlier suburbanization that was often considered sprawling at the time.

“By 1890, streetcar lines began to foster a tremendous expansion of suburban growth in cities of all sizes.”[\[5\]](#5) After the post war period, however, the automobile stared to gain traction as the major driving force for suburbanization, and this where the origins of American sprawl lie.

## TECHNOLOGY AND SPRAWL

So what technologies helped create sprawl and how so? We can look to a famous example of “white flight”, Newark, NJ, to begin to get an idea. Newark had been a booming and proud city, growing significantly all the way until the 1920s. However, with improvements like the Morris and Essex railway, things changed. “Newark’s overall population had grown by about 7 percent in the 1920s, but the exodus of the well-off meant a slow chipping away of the tax base. There was no mystery about where those with the means had retreated. Many suburban towns within commuting distance nearly doubled in population during the decade." [\[6\]](#6) Technologies like the railway are thus enablers for the creation of suburbs and ultimately sprawl; however, this does not mean they are not predestined to happen, since there were many other cities at the time with equal changes in infrastructure that kept the vibrancy of their downtown. The ultimate creator of modern sprawl is, of course, the automobile.

The car allowed for unprecedented freedom of travel for a large mass of people, the likes of which had never been seen before. Low density development and separation of uses became possible all of a sudden, and combined with a huge influx of returning veterans from World War II, and an already declining American inner-city, often gritty with manufacturing soot, loud and dirty, people flocked to new suburban developments. This quickly turned negatively, however, since unlike the railway, the development of car-based suburbia was not limited to the length of the railway. As more and more suburbs developed in the same mold, development had to get pushed farther and farther from the city center, and the ungainliness of these metropolitan areas starts to become known as what we call sprawl. Newer technologies helped to enforce and keep sprawl in place. As commute times got longer and longer with more and more sprawling developments, technologies like the telephone, and most notably the internet, allowed for telecommuting, which made distance from work less of or even a non-issue. Telecommuting has been and is still on the rise in the United Stats today, rising 79 percent between 2005 and 2012. [\[7\]](#7)

## PROBLEMS WITH SPRAWL

What are some of the problems associated with sprawl as enabled by technology? Probably the most obvious one is increased congestion and travel time.

As sprawling developments get farther and farther, more and more cars are being depended on to drive longer distances, often without significant improvement in the roadway infrastructure. This creates congestion, which is a chronic problem in most US cities. People spend hours in the car every day just to get to and from work. Not only is this horribly unproductive and frankly boring, it adds to the problem of greenhouse gas emissions. Every day, these cars take their toll on the atmosphere with their CO2 outputs. As well, Americans spend nearly 30% of our incomes on cars, insurance, gas and maintenance-costs that could go far into other areas. [\[8\]](#8) There are other costs too. The cost of building infrastructure outwards and to lower-density developments is more and more expensive and wasteful. Sprawl is often seen to have a cost in quality of social life, creating isolation and privacy from our neighbors and businesses, secluding us too much from the joys of community. Sprawl also devours important undeveloped or farming land at an alarming rate. “Over the period 2000 to 2025, under traditional sprawling development, the United States is expected to lose about 7 million acres of farmland and 7 million acres of environmentally fragile lands to real estate development. Another 5 million acres of other lands, mostly smaller, barren plots, will also be lost. In total, 18.8 million acres of farmland and other open space will be lost to development.” [\[9\]](#9)

Overall, between inefficiency of travel time, infrastructure cost, and land use, sprawl has real and dire fiscal consequences. “With all the revenues and costs calculated, under the sprawl growth scenario, development during the period 2000 to 2025 would be expected to cause an annual fiscal deficit of $43.8 billion, or 30 percent less revenues than costs by the final year of the projection period.” [\[9\]](#9) With all these problems, most young people do not even want to buy in sprawling developments, preferring compact, walkable communities, but developers are continuing to put their faith and money into sprawling developments, building bigger houses today than were built even in the 1970s. [\[10\]](#10)

## FIXING IT

So how can technology, which enabled the creation of sprawl, help to mitigate some of these negative effects? Unfortunately, it can only go so far. Two of the most obvious technologies that can easily retrofit sprawling suburbs and will go a long way to mitigate their negative effects are solar panels and electric cars. If we move to non-polluting vehicles powered by clean solar energy, in addition to solar powering our homes, the pollution and greenhouse gases created by sprawl will be nearly eliminated, reducing sprawl’s problems significantly.

EVs powered by solar panels are also cost-effective too, and can help reduce the dependence on electric grid infrastructure, solving another major problem of sprawl-the cost of infrastructure. “A household that buys an electric vehicle and also owns a solar panel system generating enough power for both the home and the electric car, the monthly cost might be just $89 per month — compared with $255 per month for a household driving a regular car without any solar panels.” [\[11\]](#11) Another, more promising technology promises to deliver even more relief from sprawl: the self-driving car. The self-driving car could create speed and mobility even on the most congested highways, by coordinating movements between cars for maximum efficiency. It could also create a system wherein ride-sharing could be incredibly cheap, allowing those who don’t have a car to take part in sprawl, reducing their inequality. Driverless cars could cut the cost of travel cost by 80 percent. [\[12\]](#12) Additionally, improvements in internet infrastructure and telecommuting will continue to keep more cars off the road and more people working at home. Ultimately however, the social problems of sprawl cannot be solved by technology, since they are in turn based on flawed social premises.

## CONCLUSION
The development of the landscape into sprawl was enabled by technologies such as the car and the internet, and when it was combined with cultural forces, the ensuing impact socially, fiscally, and culturally, has been immense, ultimately causing many problems. Technology can help mitigate some of these negative effects, but the real solution ultimately lies with better planned communities, known as “smart growth”, with compact centers and walkable amenities.

Sprawl is a perfect demonstration on the powerful effect technology can have on the landscape. It is only through better thinking and application of technology to the landscape, such as the technology of trains and mass transit, combined with socially-conscious planning, can we create better living for all.
