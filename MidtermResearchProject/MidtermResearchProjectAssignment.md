MIDTERM RESEARCH PROJECT
====

You will work on two major projects this semester, the first of which is a research project on a topic of your choice. The term "research project" here is meant to replace the idea of a paper or essay, in that while the goal is careful and rigorous historical, technical, political, and social research, the output is intended to be investigatory rather than academic.

Topics are completely up to you, but should in some way tie into the ways that technology has/is/will shape our experience of the landscape: how it has transformed the physical landscape, our ways of recording it, and/or our cultural relationship with the natural and built world. Think about topics you're personally interested in, especially ones that "echo out" into bigger and bigger ramifications – these topics will provide rich veins to explore. Examples might include things like representations of manufactured future landscapes in science fiction, modification of architectural spaces to discourage use, the use of geolocative technologies in the arts, or ancient farming technologies.

I'd like to encourage you to have a personal, conversational writing style for this project, instead of an academic tone. That doesn't mean your research or writing should be lazy, but that the output will be much more interesting if you're not trying to sound stiff and smart. Think about some of the readings we've had, or check out sites like [BLDGBLOG](http://www.bldgblog.com), Slate, and The Atlantic for examples. The goal is not simply restating facts but weaving together a compelling narrative.

The final output will be a page on this repository, archived in the `MidtermResearchProjects` folder for your classmates, present and future, to see. We'll be formatting them as [Markdown files](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), allowing for simple formatting without the pain of learning HTML. (We'll cover how to do this in the next few weeks.)

If you need help with writing or research, the [Writing and Communications Center](https://www.stevens.edu/academics/undergraduate-studies/writing-communications-center) offers peer assistance and can be very helpful.

#### PROJECT REQUIREMENTS  
I encourage you to take all assignments beyond the minimum requirements, but here are the basics your research project needs to cover:

* Minimum 1500 words (equivelant of about 3 pages single-spaced), plus citations  
* Citing at least 10 sources, 5 of which must be offline (ie journal articles, books, etc) – following citations in these texts can be a great way to find new material; you will also be encouraged to add more casual online citations in your final text (links to Wikipedia articles on key terms, for example)  
* At least 10 visual resources (photos, drawings, videos, etc) with citations  

#### TIMELINE  

* Oct 6: Topic, bibliography, and visual material due  
* Oct 13: Continue to work on project  
* Oct 20: Draft of research project due  
* Oct 27: Final draft due, publish online in class  

####OCT 27: FINAL DRAFT
For next week, please prepare the final draft of your research project. You should make changes based on the feedback you got, tighten up your argument and language, and decide what images you want to use and where they should go.

Here's the [template we're going to use](https://github.com/jeffThompson/TechnologyAndTheLandscape/blob/master/MidtermResearchProject_TEMPLATE.md) for your projects – you can download it and start filling it in, but we'll have time in class next week to do this too. You can look at [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for formatting more examples.

A note on images: JPGs are preferred, and will be displayed full-width automatically. We can put nice captions below them, so think about what those should be too.

Please bring your final version as a file and your laptop to class next week.

#### OCT 6: TOPIC, BIBLIOGRAPHY, AND VISUAL MATERIAL  
The first step in this project will be gathering sources for your research, both written and visual. Please prepare a bibliography of written texts you think you may use. This should include the citation, as well as a one-sentence annotation on how you think the source might fit. Citations should be in MLA format – you can use [this online generator](http://www.citationmachine.net/mla/cite-a-book) to make things easier.

For example:
> Reynolds, Alistair. *Redemption Ark*. New York: Ace, 2002. Print.  
Narrative descriptions of zero-gravity construction of massive spaceships and nanotechnology.

Or:
> Manaugh, Geoff. *A Burglar's Guide To The City*. New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2016. Print.  
Historical examples of techology to burglar-proof homes.

Please also start a folder on your computer for visual resources to include. When you find an image you're excited about, save it and write down a citation. I like doing this as metadata on the file itself (copy/paste the link) and in a text file. Try to get the highest quality images possible. If you find great videos, note their URLs.

Finally, when your topic is clear enough, put it into a single sentence. This should be as concise and direct as possible – it will allow us to discuss your project and will help you narrow and refine your project. This might be something like "My project examines the how the US interstate system has shaped cities and neighborhoods, both connecting rural towns and disproportionately affecting minority neighborhoods in urban centers."

Please bring a printed copy of your topic sentence and bibliography to class so we can discuss as a group.
