RECORDING AND EXTRACTING GPS TRACKS
====

We have two [Garmin eTrex 10](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/into-sports/handheld/etrex-10/prod87768.html) GPS units available for you to use.

#### RECORDING GPS TRACKS
First, make sure you are connected to a set of satellites. You will have difficulty connecting indoors, or in tight urban areas. Navigate to the Satellites page to see if you are connected. This is also cool because it shows you what satellites are currently overead.

The Garmin eTrex automatically records the entire time it's on, so once connected to satellites, you need to clear whatever data is already stored:

    Track Manager > Current Track > Clear Track...

When you're done, go back to the `Track Manager`, select the current track, and save it.

#### EXTRACTING TRACKS

To get your GPS tracks off the Garmin eTrex, connect it to your computer via USB (the plug is on the top on the back, under a rubber cover). Select `Mass Storage` mode.

Open Garmin Base Camp app (free, [download from here](http://www.garmin.com/en-US/shop/downloads/basecamp)) to transfer your tracks:

1. Go to `Transfer > Receive from Device...`  
2. Select the eTrex and choose `Tracks`  
3. Your tracks should appear in the sidebar on the left

You can get details of the track by right-clicking the track and selecting `Get Info`, which shows details for each waypoint including latitude/longitude and elevation.

#### SAVE YOUR TRACK AS GPX
To save your track out as a GPX file, go to `File > Export selected user data`, select GPX as the format and save.
