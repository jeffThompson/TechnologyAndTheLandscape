WEEK 8: PARK DESIGN
====

This week, we'll start a multi-week research/design project, creating a proposal for a new park. You'll pick a site, research it, create drawings and descriptions of your park, and create a final proposal that we'll hang in the hallway as an exhibition. Your parks need not be realistic or in useful locations, but if that's the case, your proposed park should address these things. Whatever kind of park you want to build, the main focus should be a park not only in, but *about* the landscape and our experience of it. 

*Main design challenges*  
Your project pitch should address these big design challenges, along with any other considerations relevant to your park and site:

1. How does your park interact, contrast, subvert, or amplify its unique site?  
2. How will people get into and through your park?  
3. What structures should be in the park? What other infrastructure do you need?  
4. How can you use traditional and high-tech methods to increase safety, accessibility, preservation, etc in your park?  
5. How does your park influence our experience of the landscape?  

For a really intense version of what a park proposal, and the ideation process for same, might look like, see Iowa's [State Park](http://rdgusa.com/files/2014_10_09_072110_86645000/2011-11%20-%20Iowa%20State%20Parks%20Design%20Guide%20-%20RDG%20No.%202010.425.00%20-%20low%20res.pdf) and [San Diego's](https://www.sandiego.gov/sites/default/files/legacy/park-and-recreation/pdf/parkdesign/consultantsguide2011.pdf) park design guide.

####PROJECT CALENDAR  
This project will span a few weeks, leading up to your self-proposed final projects.

* Oct 20: Project assigned, in-class ideation (homework: finish research project)  
* Oct 27: In-class work day (homework: work on draft of part project for next week)  
* Nov 3: Short crit of park proposals in progress; tech infrastructure walk in NYC (homework: finish project for next week)  
* Nov 10: Park proposals due, critique and exhibition install; assign final project  

###IN CLASS  
Today, you have a few tasks. First, we'll take a short walk around Hoboken, gathering photos of good and bad public spaces. We'll use these as case studies to being planning our parks.

* Pick a site for your park  
This can be anywhere on Earth, so we'll use Google Maps to scout locations. As you look for sites, be as specific as possible. Take screenshots of potential sites and be sure to save the URLs to the location so you can find it again.  
* Research your site  
Your park should understand the context of its site, from a cultural, political, geological, and infrastructural point of view.  
* Brainstorm solutions to design challenges  
Start thinking about the main design challenges for your park listed above – how will you address them in a way that's holistic to your park and the site?  
* Sketching  
Once you start coming up with a plan for your park, start making drawings. These can be freeform, or print out satellite images of your site and sketch on top of them.

For next week, please finish the final draft of your research projects. We'll have some time to convert them to Markdown format and upload them to Github in class, but if you want to get a headstart with the formatting, you're welcome to do so. See the [Research Project](https://github.com/jeffThompson/TechnologyAndTheLandscape/blob/master/MidtermResearchProjectAssignment.md) page for more details.

###READINGS FOR NEXT WEEK
