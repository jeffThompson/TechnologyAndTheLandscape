WEEK 12: ALGORITHMIC LANDSCAPES
====

> "The development of an organism... may be considered as the execution of a 'developmental program' present in the fertilized egg... A central task of developmental biology is to discover the underlying algorithm from the course of development." â€“Â Aristid Lindenmayer and Grzegorz Rozenberg (quoted in *Computational Beauty of Nature*)

Last week, we looked at landscapes that were imagined,Â perhaps drawn or painted (digitally or using analog methods), or existing only as words. But those places are only onscreen in small fragments and in our imaginations.Â This week, we'll look at wholly generated worlds, ones that simultaneously exist fully-formed (often so intricate as to have working systems like weather or erosion) and yet are only numbers. Many, like the games *No Man's Sky* and *Dwarf Fortress\**, are generated with immense levels of detail, more than we will even be able to actually see. Others, such as landscape-generating Twitter bots, are more humble, made with a some code and a few scraps of Unicode.

[Procedural content generation](http://pcgbook.com)\*\*, a process for making game and film assets through code rather than by hand, allows for customizable, unique, and detailed experiences that wouldn't be possible by more traditional methods. Landscapes generated this way allow for the modeling of processes (such as glaciation), the inclusion of pure mathematics (such as fractal geometry), and the correlation of data to space (like [heightmaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heightmap)).

\* You can read lots more on the making of *No Man's Sky* in [this New Yorker piece](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/world-without-end-raffi-khatchadourian).  

\*\* If you get really into this, there is an annual [Procedural Generation Jam](https://itch.io/jam/procjam), whose site include [5 hours of amazing talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wcpLwvBTYo) on the subject. You can also read **lots** more [here](http://vterrain.org/Elevation/Artificial) and [here](http://www.world-creator.com).

###IN CLASS  
Today in class, we're going to think about the landscape not from the perspective of humans (as we have all semester), but instead from the perspective of a machine. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which has some of the best and easiest to access data sets around, has a website dedicated to [data buoys](http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov), autonomous buoys floating across the world's oceans, collecting water temperature, salinity, wind speed, and other data.

Inspired by the Twitter bot [@_LostBuoy_](https://twitter.com/_LostBuoy_), which combines lines from Moby Dick and realtime information from the NOAA buoys, your assignment is to pick a buoy from the site and make something from its perspective. If you want to try your hand at creating a bot using the data, you can use [Cheap Bots Done Quick](http://cheapbotsdonequick.com) (though the learning curve is a bit high). But don't feel like you need to make anything high tech â€“Â you could also think about making a set of drawings, poems, diary entries, a song... anything. We'll spend the day working on this project, so pick something substantial and that is more than just a cursory exploration â€“ really think about how you can understand the landscape from this machine's perspective, how it differs from or is similar to ours, and about how you can have an empathetic relationship with technology.

You can get data for the last year using the following URL format:

    http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/data/stdmet/<month>/<buoy #>.txt

Which, for buoy 41041 in October, becomes this URL:

    http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/data/stdmet/Oct/41041.txt

And returns data like this:

Descriptions of what these columns mean is [available here](http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/measdes.shtml). Not all buoys are active, and not all will have data like above, but this is a good place to start.

###HOMEWORK: FINAL PROJECT  
Your final project should be a culmination of the class: a project of some kind that explores the intersection of technology and the landscape. This can be an artwork, research project, or other critical and creative work. Think about the different topics we've covered, things we didn't have time to get to in depth, time periods, and ways that the impacts of technology on the landscape reverberate outward. Think too about what you're passionate about â€“Â if possible, bring that to bear on your project, be it environmentalism, architecture, technological infrastructure, history, walking, etc.

Over the last weeks of this class, you'll develop this project into something more substantial than previous projects â€“ while past assignments were quick and meant to be exploratory, for the final I'd like you to end up with something more refined and finished. 

The overall form is up to you, but should be dictated by your project. It might be an artwork, online essay, performance, exhibition, proposal for a fictional project, printed book, etc etc etc.

###FINAL PROJECT CALENDAR  
* **Nov 17:** Park projects due, discussion of final project ideas  
* **Nov 24:** Thanksgiving, no class  
* **Dec 1:** Jeff out of town, no class â€“Â work on your final projects  
* **Dec 8:** Final projects in progress due, bring concrete work to show and get feedback, work day  
* **Date TBA:** Final presentation and critique (held in the VA&T Lab)  

###READINGS FOR NEXT WEEK  
\[ None, enjoy your Thanksgiving! ðŸ¦ƒ \]
