WEEK 3: WALKING AS A WAY OF KNOWING
====

"Thus walking as art provided a simple way for me to explore relationships between time, distance, geography and measurement. These walks are recorded in my work in the most appropriate way for each different idea: a photograph, a map, or a text work. All these forms feed the imagination." – Richard Long

Today we'll be thinking about walking as a methodology for recording the landscape. Specifically, we're going to make drawings by walking (recorded using GPS) and capture the ambiance of places and transitions between them (by recording audio).

We'll return to the idea of walking several times later in the semester: by taking walks in Minecraft and Google Maps, and randomized walks to explore NYC.

###IN CLASS: GPS DRAWINGS
Our first activity will be making drawings by walking through Hoboken, tracking our movements by GPS. You can either use our Garmin eTrex GPS units, or an app like [Trails](https://trails.io/en). There are lots of other GPS apps out there, but you'll want one that can output to the standard [GPX file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_Exchange_Format), and let you download/email the file to yourself.

GPX files are XML documents containing *tracks* for your walk, in which are *trackpoints*, containing longitude and latitude, elevation, and a timestamp. To visualize your walks, you can either use this application I've made (which will save them as a PDF), or upload it to [OpenStreetMap](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Upload_GPS_tracks) (which will show them overlaid on a map).

While making walks that spell out words or look like bunnies are fun, try something more experimental and unique. Can you set yourself rules for how you walk and see what drawing results? Can you find patterns in the streets and visualize them through your walk?

During your walk, pay attention to what's around you (and not your phone!) – think about your walk, what you see, and how this kind of walking (meant to record) feels different than walking to get somewhere.

###IN CLASS: FIELD RECORDINGS
"Deep listening is listening in every possible way, to everything possible to hear no matter what one is doing. Such intense listening involves the sound of daily life of nature of one's own thoughts as well as musical sounds. Deep listening is a life practice." – [Pauline Oliveros](http://www.arts.rpi.edu/pl/faculty-staff/pauline-oliveros)

We'll spend about an hour making field recordings of audio around campus. In our case, we're not building a library of sound effects or searching for random sounds – instead, our goal is to capture the *soundscape* of a place, the natural audio environment as a cohesive whole. This kind of recording is as much about listening as it is about capturing the sounds.

**STILL RECORDING**  
For the first recording, find a place that feels interesting and settle in. Get comfortable (you'll need to sit perfectly still for at least five minutes) and turn on the recorder. While you're sitting, really listen to the sounds around you.

**WALKING RECORDING**  
For the second recording, turn on your recorder and walk. Hold the recorder as still as possible to avoid noise from your body. Try to find changes and transitions in ambient sounds and spaces. Think about where best to start and end your recordings.

As you record outside, consider these three sound sources defined by musician and ecologist [Bernie Krause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Krause):  

* Anthrophony (human-generated sounds)  
* Biophony (non-human, non-domestic biological sounds)  
* Geophony (non-biological sources such as wind)

Also think about the [Field Recording Taxonomy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffThompson/TechnologyAndTheLandscape/master/Images/Week03/FieldRecordingTaxonomy.gif) we looked at.

###HOMEWORK  
Your homework next week is to document a walk of some kind. Plan a walk that is intentional and meaningful: think about where the walk will take place, where it will start and end, what route you take, etc (or intentionally *don't* think about these things). Find a way of documenting that walk that can culminate in or be documented by an artwork of some kind. Perhaps you create the finished piece while walking, or take back observations and materials and create the work afterwards. Think about all the examples we looked at today, but don't feel like your project has to be at all like them.

The result might be a drawing, audio recordings, a short play, photographs, visualized data, Yelp reviews... anything. Like our project last week, consider how the format of your documentation can affect how we understand your walk.

###READINGS FOR NEXT WEEK  
* *Gustav Klimt: Landscapes* (Wagner)  
* *Experimental Geography* (Paglen)  

###BRING 
Next week we will be creating maps, so please bring any tools that might be helpful to do that. We'll have the GPS units, very long tape measures, and compasses available, but feel free to bring some different tools to play with: measuring devices like standard tape measures or rulers, cameras, kites, whatever you like.
