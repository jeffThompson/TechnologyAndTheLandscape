WEEK 10: TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND EXPLORING THE URBAN LANDSCAPE
====

Many cities, and New York in particular, are over- and under-laid with technological infrastructure. New systems (fiberoptic internet, cell towers) are packed in with the old (vestigial subway control systems, sewers). This infrastructure is most often not at eye level – instead, it's above or below us, sometimes hidden but often in plain sight. This week, we'll tour downtown Manhattan and look at sites of internet infrastructure and do a bird-watching-style look at the other technological systems that coat the city.

One way of doing this is a technique developed by Guy Debord and a group called the Situationists in the 1950s: a [derivé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9rive), or randomized walk where one intentionally becomes lost or disoriented as a tool to see the city anew. As Debord said:

> The sudden change of ambiance in a street within the space of a few meters; the evident division of a city into zones of distinct psychic atmospheres; the path of least resistance that is automatically followed in aimless strolls (and which has no relation to the physical contour of the terrain); the appealing or repelling character of certain places — these phenomena all seem to be neglected. In any case they are never envisaged as depending on causes that can be uncovered by careful analysis and turned to account.

This is not unrelated to strolling (made so specific by wealthy Parisians in the 19th-century that they named it: the [Flâneur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fl%C3%A2neur) or other types of walking without a destination, the derivé is more of a tool than a pastime. The Situationists looked to activities like the derivé as a way to critically explore urban spaces almost as a philosophical/scientific-like practice. We'll use the derivé as a way to find new places and go down streets that we might otherwise miss in a familiar city and the era of smarthphone GPS.

###IN CLASS  
This week, we'll be taking a walking tour of technological infrastructure in downtown Manhattan. Starting at the WTC PATH station, we'll walk up to 60 Hudson Street (former Western Union building and the point where trans-Atlantic internet comes into NYC), 32 Avenue of the Americas (a carrier hotel), and the entrance to the Holland Tunnel. Along the way, we'll be on the lookout for tech infrastructure above and below us.

After that, we'll do a randomized walk, called a [derivé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9rive), as a way of further exploring the urban environment. We'll wrap up the day by walking to the Christopher St PATH station (or up to 111 8th Ave, current Google headquarters and formerly another carrier hotel).

###HOMEWORK  
For next week, please prepare draft materials for your park project proposal. We'll do a critique of these in class, so they should be printed single-sided (8.5x11 paper), please!
