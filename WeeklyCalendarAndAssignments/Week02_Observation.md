WEEK 2: OBSERVATION, PRE-HISTORICAL NEW JERSEY, TIMESCALE
====

###FIELD VISIT TO [LIBERTY STATE PARK](https://goo.gl/maps/NcnP3q1A8yy)

Some things you'll be able to see in and from the park:  

* Rock from the [Newark Supergroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newark_Supergroup) (not a band, though it should be) which formed in the Triassic and Jurassic periods (144-248 million years ago) and can be up to 6 kilometers thick; the weather when it formed was subtropical and rainy, creating swamps and lakes  
* We can also see [Manhattan schist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan#Bedrock), which allows for the skyscrapers in NYC and Jersey City  
* Views of the web of New York harbor, formed by the [1000-foot-thick Wisconisin Ice Sheet glacier](https://www.nycgovparks.org/about/history/geology) cutting into the schist  
* Nearby lies the Ramapo Fault zone, a 185-mile-long fault that results in recent but small earthquakes
* Most of the park is a former landfill, created by the railroads
* Wildlife, which can include lobster, starfish, osprey, dolphins, [teredos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teredo_(bivalve)) (4-foot-long worms that eat pilings), and, if you had a hydrophone, the sounds of whales less than 20 miles away  

Northern end of the park:

* The remains of the [Morris Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Canal), an inclined-plane canal built in the 1820s running from the Hudson through Newark, Bloomfield, and the Passaic River to the Delaware River with a 900-foot elevation change  
* Empty Sky Memorial, a monument to September 11  
* Former terminal of the Central Railroad of NJ and Lehigh Valley Railroad, through which 10.5 million immigrants from Ellis Island passed  

Southern end:

* Communipaw Cove, a [tidal salt marsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_marsh)  
* Industrial buildings including Daily News and Sysco  
* [Black Tom Island](http://www.njcu.edu/programs/jchistory/Pages/B_Pages/Black_Tom_Explosion.htm), now connected to the mainland by the landfill; site of a munitions depot that was sabotaged by German agents in 1915, causing an explosion felt as far away as Philadelphia  
* In the Hudson River, the US Coast Guard operates [anti-swimmer sonar systems](http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg4/cg47/docs/FinalIAS-PEA.pdf) which sweep the harbor and can distinguish between human swimmers and dolphins or seals (and includes some [work by Stevens faculty](http://brian-borowski.com/publications/PassiveAcousticThreatDetection.pdf))  
* In the southern part of the Upper Bay, the convergence of the Ambrose Channel and other shipping lanes, formerly marked by ["light ships"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightvessel) and towers before the advent of GPS; channels were blasted into the bottom of the river to depths of 32–43'

###IN CLASS
Today's class is about observing, from a variety of perspectives and means. Think about the readings from this week and their differing ways of observing the world. Also think about the idea of timescale, that this place has existed in so many different ways over its history, many of which echo into today.

We have several exercises to explore the park:

**WEEKLY DRAWINGS**  
"Drawing has always been an absolutely primary way of encountering reality." – Milton Glaser

For the first 15 minutes, draw in your sketchbook anything around you. Think about what's close and what's far, drawings of objects and spaces (but no skylines, please!), or using marks to convey the activities and textures you see. Don’t rush to finish a drawing, even if it isn’t going well. Give yourself plenty and use the process of drawing as a way to let you see.

**SMELL WALK**  
"Smells have layers, like sounds have frequencies. Disentangling them is like trying to follow a song in a room full of loud people – you have to learn to tune out the other noises." – E.E. Georgi

Walk around the park and gather smells (the human nose can discern about one trillion different aromas). How do you describe them? Can smells be categorized together in some way? What is the intensity of the smell? Record the smells in some way here (it can be notes, diagrams, shapes... anything).

This is based on the great work by artist [Kate McLean](http://sensorymaps.com/about) (you can see her detailed ["Smellfie Kit"](http://sensorymaps.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Smellwalk_Intro_Kit_%C2%A9KateMcLean_2015.pdf) for more info)  

**DIAGRAM AN OBSERVED PROCESS**  
Create a diagram that describes a process (natural or human-made) you observe in the park. Think about the timescale you’re showing – does the process take a few minutes, the flash of an atomic decay, or geologically significant time? The aesthetic look of the diagram can be anything you want: flowchart, gestural sketch, tracing, or mechanical drawing. 

**RECORD THE WEATHER**  
"All clouds except a narrow opening at the top of the sky. All cloudy except a narrow opening at the bottom of the sky with others smaller. All cloudy except a narrow opening at the bottom of the sky. All cloudy except a narrow opening at the bottom of the sky. All cloudy. All cloudy. All cloudy. Except one large opening with others smaller." – Lisa Robertson, *The Weather*

Using any means, record the current weather. This could be a minute snapshot of the current conditions, a time-lapse of the entire visit, or a culmination of 100 years of data.

You can also [download the worksheets](https://github.com/jeffThompson/TechnologyAndTheLandscape/blob/master/Resources/ObservationWorksheets.pdf) describing each of the activities.

###RESOURCES AND PROJECTS SHOWN  
* Lots more info on the [geological history of NYC and New Jersey](http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/picks-from-the-past/081586/geology-of-new-york-city-and-its-vicinity)
* NOAA charts of the New York harbor ([#12335](http://www.charts.noaa.gov/PDFs/12335.pdf) and [#12327](http://www.charts.noaa.gov/PDFs/12327.pdf))

* Friends of the Pleistocene's [Geologic City: A Field Guide to the Geoarchitecture of New York](https://fopnews.wordpress.com/2010/08/05/geologic-city-a-field-guide-to-the-geoarchitecture-of-new-york), examining NYC’s architecture from the point of view of rocks and geology  
* A few articles on ideas related to timescale, including [deep time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_time), [orders of magnitude related to time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(time)), and [shifts in the scientific definition of the Earth’s place in the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_location_in_the_Universe)  

###HOMEWORK  
Your assignment for next week is to investigate and record a three-cubic-foot location (ie 3-feet wide by 3-feet deep by 3-feet tall*). You can do this in any place you want, using any methodology and materials. Think of yourself as an artistic archeologist, uncovering and recording as many minute details as possible.

What you record can be literal, such as objects found or temperatures recorded. It can also be things that echo outwards, such as what that place might have been like at different times, or experiential and tied to your experience of the place. Overall, the goal is to observe – look, listen, and record as carefully and meticulously as possible! You don't have to record *everything*, so think about what makes sense to your site and is of interest to you.

The ultimate format of your recordings is up to you, but should be merged into a cohesive, creative presentation. We will present and discuss these at the beginning of class next week. Think about how your final output helps our understanding of your observations – with the exception of video and other things that are intentionally projected, digital images should be printed.

As with all our projects, this is meant to be exploratory, as much about how you approach it as it is about what the result is. Be bold and experimental!
  
\* *Above- or below-ground (or a mix) is up to you, but be sure to get permission if you’re going to dig somewhere.*

###READINGS FOR NEXT WEEK  
* *Bug Spotting: NSA Nature Walks* (Guardian)  
* *The Soundscape* (Schafer)

###BRING 
Next week we will spend most of the day walking, so please bring comfy shoes, water, sunscreen, etc like this week. We will also be making GPS drawings and field recordings, so please bring your phone charged up and ready. You may want to install a free GPS logging app like [Trails](https://trails.io/en), though we have two GPS units you can use too.
