WEEK 6: EXPLORATION AND VISITING PLACES WE'VE NEVER BEEN
====

**PLEASE NOTE! Class is canceled this week. See you next week for our visit to Central Park.**

This week, we'll be exploring wild terrains and new cities, but through the lens of the satellite. While our garbage may have reached deep into the ocean, [17% of the Earth](http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/wildareas-v2-human-footprint-geographic) is still remote enough not to be touched by humans and we've explored [less than 5% of the oceans](http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/exploration.html).

Long journeys have spurred technological advances in sailing, food storage, navigational instruments, and map-making. Of course, the history of exploration (especially European) is riddled with attitudes of conquering, [manifest destiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny), and the natural world as a place to be stripped of valuables. 

Today, as we voyage across the surface of the Earth with ease, we'll also think about questions like:  

* Is it ok to visit culturally-different places without learning about them first? What about doing it virtually like we are?  
* Are we (American, well-educated, relatively wealthy) intruding when we visit these places?  
* What can/should we do when exploring new places to balance our curiosity with the history of colonialism that is so inseparable from exploration?

###IN CLASS  
The goal today is to traverse places you've never been, whether they be nearby or on the other side of the world. Explorers of the past were forced to make long journeys to new places (or new for them, at least), but today we'll use Google Maps as our means of travel. You're free to go anywhere you want (don't forget the oceans!) and as many different places as you like. Our goal will be to collect interesting images and experiences, and to think about what this kind of exploration means today from a technological and cultural perspective.

Along the way, consider a few technical things:

* Try different zoom levels and see how it changes the landscape  
* When you find an interesting place, feature, or pattern, take a screenshot (command+shift+3 on a Mac, [various methods on Windows](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-take-a-screenshot-in-any-version-of-windows))  

We'll end with a demo of traditional Japanese stab bookbinding to create chapbooks of the poems and drawings you made last week.

###HOMEWORK  
This week, you will continue work on your [Research Project](https://github.com/jeffThompson/TechnologyAndTheLandscape/blob/master/MidtermResearchProjectAssignment.md), starting a rough draft of your post. This draft is due in two weeks (Oct 20), but please use this week to start writing, giving yourself enough time to do further research as needed.

###READINGS FOR NEXT WEEK  

[ None required, please work on your research projects ]

###BRING 
Next week, we'll be visiting Central Park during class. We'll leave from the classroom right at the start of class in order to have enough time, so please arrive by 1pm ready to go. We'll walk down to the PATH together, switch to the subway and get off at the [81st Street Museum of Natural History A/B/C stop](https://www.google.com/maps/place/81+St+-+Museum+of+Natural+History/@40.7819788,-73.9720134,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x145ef5ddf63a434e!8m2!3d40.7819788!4d-73.9720134) – you're welcome to join us there instead of in class, but please let me know ahead of time.

Please bring a comfortable pair of shoes and your sketchbooks, there will be no need for your laptops. If at all possible, please be sure to fill up your Metro Card before class.
