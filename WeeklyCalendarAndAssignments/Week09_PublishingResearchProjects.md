WEEK 9: PUBLISHING RESEARCH PROJECTS, WORK DAY
====

Today, we'll be publishing your research projects to the class Github repository and working on your park projects.

**FORMATTING MIDTERM RESEARCH PROJECTS**  
Please review the [research project Markdown template](https://github.com/jeffThompson/TechnologyAndTheLandscape/blob/master/MidtermResearchProject_TEMPLATE.md) and this [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for formatting. If you've never used Markdown before, I suggest using [this online editor](http://dillinger.io/) for realtime formatting.

Images should be in a folder called `images`, so you can link to them with `images/ImageFilename.jpg`. Once your file is ready, we'll put it on a thumb drive and upload it. You can then check to make sure everything looks ok and make tweaks.

###PARK PROJECT CALENDAR  
A reminder where we're at in the park projectÂ â€“Â **note the change in deadlines:**

* **Oct 20:** Project assigned, in-class ideation (homework: finish research project)  
* **Oct 27:** In-class work day (homework: none, take a break!)  
* **Nov 3:** Tech infrastructure walk in NYC   
* **Nov 10:** Short crit of park proposals in progress; future landscapes and sci fi; assign final project (homework: finish project for next week, final project pitches)  
* **Nov 17:** Park proposals due, critique and exhibition install; algorithmic landscapes  

###IN CLASS  
Depending on where you're at from last week, here's where to start on your park proposal:

* **Pick a site for your park**  
This can be anywhere on Earth (and above/below the surface), so we'll use Google Maps to scout locations. As you look for sites, be as specific as possible. Take screenshots of potential sites and be sure to save the URLs to the location so you can find it again.  
* **Research your site**  
Your park should understand the context of its site from a cultural, political, geological, and infrastructural point of view. Take notes of relevant information â€“Â you'll compile this later into a narrative about your park and your design decisions.  
* **Brainstorm solutions to design challenges**  
Start thinking about the main design challenges for your park listed above â€“Â how will you address them in a way that's holistic to your park and the site?  
* **Sketching**  
Once you start coming up with a plan for your park, start making drawings. These can be freeform, or print out satellite images of your site and sketch on top of them.  

Once you've done this work, the next step will be figuring out what format makes most sense for your park's proposal and start working on it. You should aim for about 10-pages-worth of material, but that may include images, text, etc. This doesn't need to be formal, academic, or sound like a normal park proposal (the opposite is encouraged, actuall!) but should be carefully made to reflect your park.

###HOMEWORK  
None â€“ take a break! ðŸ˜€

###READINGS FOR NEXT WEEK  
* "Capture World" from *A Burglar's Guide to the City* (Manaugh)  
* *Networks of New York* (Burrington)  
* "Planet of the Drums" from *Sonic Warfare* (Goodman)  
* "The Longest Tubes" from *Tubes* (Blum)  
* "Your Activities May Leave Footprints" from *Data Space* (CLOG)  

###NEXT WEEK  
Next week, weather permitting, we'll be doing a walking tour of technological infrastructure in downtown NYC, as well as a derivÃ©. Please bring your MetroCards (we'll just be taking the PATH to WTC, no subway) and be prepared to spend a few hours walking. Comfy shoes are a must! You'll also want to bring your cameras and any other devices you might want â€“Â no laptops needed. We'll meet in the classroom right at 1pm and head to the station. If you'd like to meet us at the station or in NYC, please let me know ahead of time.
