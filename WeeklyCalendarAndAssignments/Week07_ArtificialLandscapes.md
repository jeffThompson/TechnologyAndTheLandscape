WEEK 7: ARTIFICIAL LANDSCAPES
====

Thus far this semester, we've looked at the landscape from a variety of timescales and perspectives, but mostly places that have been minimally modified by humans. Starting this week, we'll be shifting to landscapes thoroughly shaped by us, using Central Park as a model.

Designed and built in the 1850s by Frederick Law Olmsted, the park is a perfect example of landscapes created, rather than found. Olmsted's design was meant to mimick meandering trails, scenic ponds, and grassy fields found in a natural location, but was actually meticulously crafted down to the individual plant. Every view from every point on every path was planned to create picturesque experiences, much like the Grand Tour discussed two weeks ago. The park's seven ponds were all created artificially, and 18,500 cubic yards of dirt were brough in from New Jersey to improve the soil.

Central Park too covers a dark history: thousands of poor immigrant and African American farmers were forced off the land by emminent domain in order to build the park. The park is now flanked by some of the most expensive real estate in the country.

###IN CLASS  
This week we'll be visiting Central Park – we'll meet in the classroom and head to the PATH train. If you want to meet us there, please just let me know ahead of time. We'll walk around the park and make drawings and observations in preparation for our upcoming Park Design project.

###HOMEWORK  
For next week, please finish your draft of your research project. Drafts should be emailed to me at [jeff.thompson@stevens.edu](mailto:jeff.thompson@stevens.edu) by the start of class.

###READINGS FOR NEXT WEEK  
[ None required, please work on your research projects ]
