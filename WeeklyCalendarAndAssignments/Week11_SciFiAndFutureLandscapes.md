WEEK 11: SCI FI AND FUTURE LANDSCAPES
====

So far this semester, we've only looked at landscapes that actually exist. But this week and next, we'll be examining landscapes that we imagine could be. Science fiction has from the start considered places we have not yet visited, including planets, moons, asteroids, and other celestial bodies, as well as human-made structures such as dense cities and space stations.

Ridley Scott's *Alien* series (of which both *Prometheus* and, to a lesser extent, *Blade Runner*, are a part of the same universe) is centered around [Weyland-Yutani](http://avp.wikia.com/wiki/Weyland-Yutani), a company that mines on asteroids – their company motto is "building better worlds". While it may seem unlikely that this could happen in our lifetime, last year president Obama signed a law allowing "commercial extraction of minerals and other materials, including water, from asteroids and the moon" (via [this fascinating article](http://phys.org/news/2015-12-space-law-interplanetary-gold.html)).

In the world of science fiction, *Prometheus* co-writer Damon Lindelof suggests that "Space exploration in the future is going to evolve into this idea that it's not just about going out there and finding planets to build colonies. It also has this inherent idea that the further we go out, the more we learn about ourselves." In many of these instances, the imagined future is grim: shades of dirty gray or antiseptic white, with both the promise of technology and an inevitable destruction that comes with it. Sci fi films use the landscape not just as a setting, but as a metaphorical vehicle to explore our relationship with technology.

###HOMEWORK  
For next week, please finish your park proposals. These should be printed on 8.5x11" paper – good quality prints, please! Use our laser printer in the Lab if necessary. We'll install these in an exhibition next week, so if you have other materials you'd like to include (research material, maps, objects, etc) be sure to bring those too.

Additionally, please start thinking about your final projects. Next week, after we hang your park proposals, we'll have a "pitch session" where you tell us about your final project idea and we'll give feedback. Come with an idea that's concrete enough for us to talk about.
