WEEK 4: MAPPING AND THE TECHNOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE
====

> "How do we learn to think in a synchronic way? Through using machines. Genuinely radical changes in the human conception of time are not caused by philosophy, but by instrumentation. The most radical changes in our temporal outlook come from technological devices, tools of temporal perception: clocks, telescopes, radio-carbon daters, spectrometers. It was through these instruments that we learned that the universe is 13.7 billion years old, that the planet is 4.45 billion year old, that our species is some 200,000 years old. Compared to those mechanically assisted vistas, all previous human notions... are parochial."
â€“Â Bruce Sterling, *Shaping Things*

This week, we will explore what is probably the first technology that comes to mind when thinking of the landscape: maps. Long before satellites and drones, maps allowed us to see a different view of the world, to see how places related to one another.

Historically, simple mapping tools like the [quadrant](https://github.com/jeffThompson/TechnologyAndTheLandscape/tree/master/Resources/LasercutQuadrant) and [Gunter's chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunter%27s_chain) gave way to more complex ones like the [Philadelphia rod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_rod) and [theodolite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodolite), and have all but been replaced by satellite imaging and databases. Maps present a technological perspective of the world: even climbing a hill for a broader view is a way of seeing the landscape that is separated from our daily experience of it. They all are views filtered through the eyes of technology. 

No matter how they're made, maps show as much as they hide, and map-making is an inherently political activity. Earlier this year, Google Maps was accused of removing Palestine from their map (it was never there to begin with). This history extends back as far as we have been making maps â€“Â a good example being the [Ordnance Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey] in Great Britain, producing maps as public service and as a way of controlling people. Even the [way we draw squares on the map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gall%E2%80%93Peters_projection) is frought with challenges and compromises. (In cartography, the process of critical analysis is called ["deconstruction"](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/passages/4761530.0003.008/--deconstructing-the-map?rgn=main;view=fulltext).)

Our goal this week is to explore ways that maps are made, from both critical and practical perspectives.

###IN CLASS
During class, we'll explore a traditional mapping technique through a hands-on, experimental lens. This isn't about learning insanely deep tools like GIS or making perfect maps (you should take courses in civil engineering and cartography for that), but as a way to think about mapping as a tool for capturing and recording the landscape.

Starting from a single point on campus, we'll map out the boundaries of an area using our compasses to determine angle and a measuring tape or wheel to record distance. For more accuracy, this should probably be done with transits and invar measuring tapes, or with laser rangefinders, but we'll settle for a DIY approach. You can record your angles either as azimuths (0â€“360Âº) or bearings (cardinal direction). Optionally, you can also try to record elevation changes using our homemade quadrants.

Carefully set points, called geodedic benchmarks, can be found all around the US and are used as starting points for survey crews. You can search for many of them on this [NOAA map](http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/NGSDataExplorer) â€“ there's on on the Stevens campus (PID: [KV0293](http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_mark.prl?PidBox=KV4284)). There are lots of [different types](https://www.geocaching.com/mark/#kinds), created by government agencies and private companies.

Feel free to try out some other mapping ideas if you have them, or to record additional data long the way. For example, you could consider gridding an area you've plotted and make EMF readings in each grid square.

**MAGNETIC DECLINATION**  
Magnetic north isn't at the north pole, and this difference is called *magnetic declination*. With the GPS coordinates of the Morton building on 22 September 2016, declination is 12.93ÂºW (Â±0.36Âº) and changes by 0.03ÂºE per year (via [NOAA's calculator](http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag-web/#declination)). To use this, shift your compass readings by 12.93Âº to the west.

###HOMEWORK  
Your homework this week is to create a map of your surroundings. How you define "surroundings" is up to you, but should be made from observations and, optionally, research. Your methodology for observing can be traditional or experimental, but strive for accuracy and care, like any map-maker. You can also use existing data to create your map, such as geomagnetic readings.

Materials, format, content, etc is up to you as well â€“Â maps can be drawn or printed, but can also be made of sound, video, smells, etc. Think about the projects we've looked at and how maps inherently edit what is shown about the world.

Other things to think about:

* What scale is your map at? How do you show it?  
* What names do you give to places, especially when they might have more than one? What places have their names ommitted? Or do you create your own place names?  
* What symbols do you use to indicate things like terrain or features of interest?

As you consider and what to show, it may be helpful to think about these categories of topology used in maps:

* Arc-Node: lines that share enpoints (ex: several roads leading into a city)  
* Polygon: areas sharing boundaries (ex: border between two states)  
* Route: a line sharing some segments with another line (ex: two roads that merge for a time, then separate again)  
* Region: areas overlapping with other areas (ex: city region inside a county region)  
* Node: a line that shares an endpoint with a point (ex: road leading to a building)  
* Point Events: a point that shares a vertex with a line (ex: exits along a freeway)  

###READINGS FOR NEXT WEEK  
* *Haikus* (Basho)  
* *Rip Rap Poems* (Snyder)  
* Selections from *In The Clearing* (Frost)  
* Selections from *Nine Horses* (Collins)  
* Selections from *Morning Poems* (Bly)  

###BRING 
Next week, please bring your laptop with [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/en/download)] installed and tested. **There is no need to buy the full game (though you can!).**

1. [Download Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/en/download) for your system  
2. Start the application and click "Register" to create an account  
3. Sign up with your email and a password, confirm your email  
4. Sign in with your new account  
5. Test that everything works by selecting "Play Demo"; the application should launch  
6. The demo only lasts 100 minutes, but the world can be reset again after that time â€“Â since we're not building anything, that's just fine  
7. If you already use Minecraft and have an account, you'll need to create a new, blank world next week  

Please test this out before class and let me know if you run into any issues. Also bring your sketchbook and drawing implements.
