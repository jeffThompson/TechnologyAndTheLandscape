WEEK 1

Introductions and syllabus

###LECTURE
Introductory talk ([slides](https://github.com/jeffThompson/TechnologyAndTheLandscape/blob/master/Lectures/IntroToTechnologyAndTheLansdcape.pdf)): transformation of the landscape, examples (Institute for Advanced Study computer, printing press and spray paint), goals for the class

###IN CLASS
"It is only through drawing that I actually look at things carefully." – Milton Glaser

Make sketchbooks:

* Cut at least 20 sheets of paper to any size (but no smaller than a quarter page) and matching covers  
* Coil binding demos, bind sketchbooks  
* You can bring more paper in the following weeks to add, if you want  
* Won’t ever collect your sketchbooks, though we may take out pages of drawings you’re proud of to show later  

Observational drawing and writing exercises:

* Beginning of a weekly drawing practice at the start of every class  
* Not about "good" drawings in a technical sense, but about close looking  
* Two rules: no skylines and no phones!  
* Multiple drawings per prompt ok, but do take enough time to really look – this can very much be about slowing yourself down!  
* Spend 10 minutes drawing the view from where you’re sitting  
* Spend 10 minutes drawing something very close to you  
* Spend 10 minutes writing down everything that you see  
* Spend 10 minutes writing about a piece of technology present in or effecting the landscape around you: describe it, and how it changes the landscape and/or your experience of it

###HOMEWORK
For next week, your assignment is to gather supplies necessary for us to go on our first field visit. You'll need drawing materials of your choice for our weekly drawings. We'll often be away from the classroom, so plan ahead! (For example: if you're drawing with pencils, bring a knife to sharpen them.) Feel free to grab more and different papers to add to your sketchbook throughout the semester as well – colored, gridded, thick/thin for different media, etc.

A few to consider, though please always have at least two options with you every week:

* Pencils and erasers  
* Pens (felt-tip, ballpoint, nib)  
* Charcoal or pastel (though you’ll need to carry spray fix)  
* Portable watercolor set  
* Ink wash  
* Or go crazy: homemade dye, brushes made from found materials, etc  

For field visits like next week, please also bring a pair of comfortable shoes, water and snacks, and sunscreen and bug spray if you want it. We’ll meet in the classroom and leave right at 1pm, so please be on time and ready to go. You may also want to bring a pocket knife (a legal one, please), backup phone battery, and anything that you might want to use to record data (camera, GPS, tape measure, etc) though we will cover specific tools at various points in the semester, so no need yet.

Specifically, next week we’ll be going to [Liberty State Park](https://goo.gl/maps/a3oiR6x2f1E2). We’ll walk to Hoboken Terminal and take the light rail – fares are $2.25 each way, so please bring a card or cash. If you’d prefer to walk back to Hoboken (about 4 miles) I’d be happy to join you along the riverfront, but this is completely optional.

Your other assignment every week will be the readings. They are listed by the week they are due, and include supplemental PDFs as suggestions if you want to dig deeper.

* *Grapefruit* (Ono)  
* *The Goose Lake Trail* (Eliasson/Obrist)  
* *An Attempt to Exhaust A Place in Paris* (Perec)
